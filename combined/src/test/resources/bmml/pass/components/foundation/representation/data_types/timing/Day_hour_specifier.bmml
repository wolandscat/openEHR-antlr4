    |
    | Specification of days within a week or month, or other possible bounding period.
    | The value both human- and machine-readable. It takes one of the following forms:
    |
    | * the string `"daily"`:
    | ** the fixed string `"daily"`, to mean every day.
    | * days in week - a string of the form `"week: Mo, Tu, Fr, ..."`, where the part following the colon is a comma-separated list of day codes, as follows:
    | ** Monday: `"Mo"`;
    | ** Tuesday: `"Tu"`;
    | ** Wednesday: `"We"`;
    | ** Thursday: `"Th"`;
    | ** Friday: `"Fr"`;
    | ** Saturday: `"Sa"`;
    | ** Sunday: `"Su"`.
    | * days in month: a string of the form "month: 01, 14, ..."` where the part following the colon is a comma-separated list of items which can be:
    | ** 2-digit day numbers from "01" to" 31";
    | ** keywords: `"first"`, `"last"`, `"second-last"`, etc.
    |
    | The string value is treated as case-insensitive, and whitespace is ignored. Consequently, mixed case and spacing can be used to improve human-readability.
    |
    | The value 'every day' can be represented by a full week or month list, or for convenience, the value `"daily"`.
    |
    prop days_spec : String;

    |
    | a string pattern like "1/3" or "2/4" whose numerator is the position of the occurrences base period,
    | and whose denominator is the number of base periods in a full cycle. Defaults to "1/1"
